            <p>Our eating habits affect how we feel during the day. What happens if I have no breakfast, or poor breakfast? I'm likely to be tired or cross, and, of course, hungry till having lunch.
                There is a ring of truth in that well-known say-ing: "A man is what he eats". Food is a form of fuel.
                It gives us energy, helps us to grow, resist disease and form strong teeth and bones. No single food can take care of all our body's needs. Different foods do different things for the body. Some foods are better than others in helping make strong muscles. Among them are meats, eggs, fish, and poultry. Some foods are better than others in helping keep bones, teeth, skin, and blood healthy. Among these foods are fruit, vegetables, milk, and cheese.
                There are certain sayings about foods from long ago.
                "Fish is brain's food"; people say it's good for the brain.
                They say carrots are good for the eyes. Another saying is:
                "An apple a day keeps the doctor away", meaning that you will be healthy if you eat an apple every day.
                Almost all food can be eaten without any cooking at all. Most people eat raw fruit, and raw vegetables in salads, and the Japanese particularly like raw fish.
                However, some foods are much softer and easier to chew if they have been cooked. They may also be easier to digest. When cooking, we often combine many different ingredients together. This can make food look and taste much better. Compare the taste of chocolate cake, for example, with that of its raw ingredients of flour, sugar, fat, cocoa and egg. Different ideas about which foods to mix together bring people to cooking a great many of different dishes of the world.
                There are so many kinds of food from which to choose — fast food, snacks, junk food - that it may be difficult to follow a healthy diet. Fresh fruit and vegetables are important for our health. In the past, sailors who went on long sea voyages stayed on their ships for many months without going ashore. They did not get fresh food and so often suffered from a disease called scurvy. Scurvy is caused by a lack of vitamin C, which is found in fruit and vegetables.
                In our country, bread is an important part of our everyday food. When we sit down for a meal, there is always bread on the table. For breakfast, we have bread witor luter or cheese. Some peoplest, ve Yam or olivedish. Aunch, we have bread with a mave or vegetable dish. Again at dinner, we eat bread mitt whatever food there is on the table. When there is rice or potatoes, we have bread, too. My granny says that if there is no bread, there is no food.

<h2>Grammar : </h2>

<div class="content">
    <h1>Subjunctive Mood: Full Explanation</h1>
    <iframe src="Lesson 14. Subjunctive Mood.pdf" width="780" height="569" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

    <div class="subjunctive-content">
        <p>The <span class="important">subjunctive mood</span> is a grammatical mood used to express various states of unreality such as wishes, doubts, hypothetical situations, suggestions, or conditions that are not yet true or are unlikely to happen. Unlike the indicative mood, which is used for stating facts, the subjunctive is used to discuss things that are not certain or are imagined.</p>

        <h2>When to Use the Subjunctive Mood:</h2>
        <p>The subjunctive mood is most commonly used in the following specific situations:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="important">Wishes and Desires:</span> When we express a wish, desire, or want, we use the subjunctive after certain verbs (e.g., wish, hope, prefer, recommend).</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> I wish that he <span class="important">were</span> here. (Not "was" because it's a wish about a situation contrary to reality)</p>
            </div>

            <li><span class="important">Hypothetical or Unlikely Situations:</span> The subjunctive is used in "if" clauses (conditional sentences) to talk about situations that are hypothetical, unreal, or unlikely to happen.</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If I <span class="important">were</span> you, I would eat more fruits and vegetables for better health.</p>
            </div>

            <li><span class="important">Suggestions and Recommendations:</span> The subjunctive is used after verbs that suggest, recommend, or insist that someone do something.</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> The doctor recommends that you <span class="important">eat</span> more vegetables to improve your health.</p>
            </div>

            <li><span class="important">Expressions of Necessity:</span> After certain verbs and expressions of necessity (e.g., it’s important that, it’s necessary that), we use the subjunctive.</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> It is important that she <span class="important">be</span> on time for the meeting.</p>
            </div>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subjunctive-content">
        <h2>Forms of the Subjunctive</h2>
        <p>The subjunctive has the following forms:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="important">For Regular Verbs:</span> In the present subjunctive, the verb remains in its base form, regardless of the subject.</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> I suggest that he <span class="important">go</span> to the gym every day.</p>
            </div>

            <li><span class="important">For “To Be”:</span> The verb “to be” is irregular in the subjunctive. For all subjects, the form is <span class="important">were</span>.</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If I <span class="important">were</span> a nutritionist, I would recommend a balanced diet.</p>
            </div>

            <li><span class="important">Past Subjunctive:</span> Often used in conditional or hypothetical statements, it expresses an unreal or impossible situation.</li>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If I <span class="important">had been</span> more active, I would have had more energy.</p>
            </div>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="subjunctive-content">
        <h2>Key Verbs & Phrases that Trigger the Subjunctive</h2>
        <p>Some verbs and phrases that often trigger the subjunctive mood include:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="important">Verbs:</span> suggest, recommend, wish, prefer, demand, insist, request, ask, desire</li>
            <li><span class="important">Phrases:</span> it’s important that, it’s necessary that, it’s better that, it’s essential that, if I were you, as if</li>

            <h2>Lesson 15 : "Gateway of America"( New York )    </h2>
            <p>"New York City, known as the “Gateway of America,” is a vibrant, multicultural hub with iconic landmarks, a rich history starting from its purchase as Manhattan in 1626, and a unique role as the nation’s financial, cultural, and international center."</p>
            <h2>Reading:</h2>
            <p>New York City. Some call it a poem in stone and steel, others a soul-less monster. It is unlike any other city in the world.
                At the beginning of the 17th century only the wigwams of the Iroquois stood where the skyscrapers of New York now reach to the clouds. In 1626 the Dutch bought the island from the natives for the ridiculously low price of 24 dollars worth of beads and trinkets.
                Later the Indians named the island "Manhattan" which in Iroquois means "They cheated us". Present-day Manhattan is the main borough of New York City, which consists of five boroughs altogether.
                New York has two natural advantages: it is located at the mouth of the Hudson River, and it is
                well located for travel and trade between the United States and Europe.
                At the turn of the present century millions of people driven by poverty emigrated to the United States from various countries of Europe. They en. tered the New World through New York, the "Gate-way of America". Hundreds of thousands of them settled down in that city. That is what makes people call it the "Modern Babylon".
                Near the southern end of Manhattan Island is a smaller island called Liberty Island. On it stands one of the most beloved statues in the country, the Statue of Liberty. To many people who have come to the USA from foreign lands this statue has given the first wel. coming greeting from the free people of America.
                New York City attracts people from all over. If you get on a subway in New York and look at the newspapers that people are reading you can see them in many languages, including Spanish, Chinese, Ara-bic, Russian, Italian, Hebrew, and French.
                While New York is composed of five boroughs, joined together in 1898, the place most people come to visit is Manhattan. Here at the lower end of Man. hattan is the largest financial district in the USA, with thousands of stockbrokers, investment banks, and headquarters of many large corporations.
                A few miles uptown in Manhattan are Greenwich Village and the East Village, both have always been at the center of New York's excitement. Both have an active night-life with a large variety of bars, restaurants, and clubs.
                In midtown Manhattan, one finds the most familiar sites -  Rockefeller Centre, Radio Music City Hall, The Museum of Modern Art, and Carnegie Hall.
                On the East side stands the United Nations complex.
                Times Square in Manhattan is at the heart of the theatre district — the area where Broadway is located with its many theatre companies.
                New York City is, in many ways, America's premier city. It's the nation's financial, communica-tions, and cultural centre. Above all, it is an international city, housing the General Assembly and the Security Council of the United Nations.
                The streets of Manhattan are themselves sym-bolic: Madison Avenue for advertising, Wall Street for finance, Broadway for theatre, Seventh Avenue for fashion, and Fifth Avenue for elegant shopping.
                Unlike Tokyo or London, Paris or Beijing (Peking), New York City is alive 24 hours a day, a place where buses and subways operate round the clock. New York is a city of extremes. Its hotels, apartment houses, restaurants, and shops rank with the most exclusive and expensive anywhere. In contrast, the city also has more the homeless, drug addicts, and the ill, than any other city...

                <h2>What Are Collocations?</h2>
                <p>
                    Collocations are combinations of words that naturally go together in a language. They sound "right" to native speakers because they are commonly used together. 
                    For instance:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>"Make a mistake"</strong> is correct, but <strong>"do a mistake"</strong> is not.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Fast food"</strong> is correct, but <strong>"quick food"</strong> sounds unnatural.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Collocations make language more fluent and natural, helping learners avoid awkward or incorrect expressions.

            <section id="importance">
                <h2>Why Are Collocations Important?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sound More Natural:</strong> Using collocations improves your fluency and makes your English closer to that of native speakers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Better Comprehension:</strong> Understanding collocations helps you read and listen more effectively, as many expressions are built from common word pairings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Improved Writing and Speaking:</strong> Collocations add precision and depth to your communication. For example, instead of saying <em>"very tired,"</em> you can say <em>"completely exhausted."</em></li>

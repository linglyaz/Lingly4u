            <p> Napoleon Bonaparte (1769 - 1821), one of history's great military geniuses and conquerors, had grand ambitions for a world empire, and by 1805 controlled the length of the Atlantic coastline from Belgium to northern Italy. It was not too long before the rulers of Austria and Russia joined Great Britain, and later Prussia, in their opposition to French ex-pansion. Austria eventually declared war on France, but Napoleon crushed the Austrians in one battle, and then devastated a combined Austrian and Russian force at Austerlitz, his greatest victory accord. ing to some reports. He later defeated a separate Prussian force. Only a naval defeat kept him from launching an invasion of Britain at that time. 
                Napoleon next cleverly negotiated a pact with Czar Alexander I of Russia, and the two leaders di. vided control over the European continent, the Rus. sians to be in control of eastern Europe and France in control of the west.
                Napoleon also established his "Continental System", consisting of a naval blockade intended to keep Britain from trading with the European continent.
                When Portugal and Spain refused to cooperate in the blockade, he led a French army into those countries and conquered them.
                When Czar Alexander I similarly refused to close Russia's ports to Britain, Napoleon gathered a massive army to threaten him, but Czar Alexander I would not give in.
                In June 1812, Napoleon invaded Russia. To his surprise, the Russian military commander, Kutuzov, did not rush forward to challenge him. Instead, Ku-tuzov slowly retreated, destroying as he fell back all the crops, all of the shelter - indeed anything that might be of use to Napoleon's army. Today, such tactics are called a "scorched earth" policy.
                In September, at Borodino, Napoleon finally engaged Kutuzov in a bloody battle, managing to defeat him and to move on to Moscow, the Russian capital.
                Again the Russians fell back, leaving Moscow deserted. The day after Napoleon's troops arrived a fire broke out, turning the city into a sea of flames and almost totally destroying it. Meanwhile, Czar Alexander I still refused to meet with Napoleon to ne-gotiate.
                In the year 1812, an early winter happened in Russia. Without shelter, without food, French soldiers died by the thousands to the freezing cold. Napoleon finally realized he had no choice but to with-draw. He retreated through the snowy drifts, his troops were pursued at every turn by Kutuzov's Cossack horsemen. Of the army composed of 450,000 men that had entered Russia in June, only 10,000 were fit for combat by the time of Napoleon's return to France.
                Now, seeing their chance, the subject nations of Europe rose up against their French masters. Prussia and Austria announced a new alliance with Great Britain and Russia against Napoleon. They demanded that he return conquered territories that he had added to the French empire.
                In October 1813, at Leipzig - in the so-called battle of the Nations - the combined Allied Forces decisively defeated Napoleon's Grande Army. That was the end of the empire ambitions for the great leader of France and his grand idea of the unification of continental Europe.

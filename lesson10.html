            <p>Some students like school, others think they hate it, but they all study for ten or more years and gain knowledge and develop experience by doing many different tasks. For students who are doing well in most subjects, and have particular interest in going on to higher education, school is an attractive place. But those who are not successful with their grades, and are always pressed by teachers and their parents, consider school boring and uninteresting.
                School is not only a place of formal education, it is a place where students can develop their skills in social relationships, and increase their tolerance and mutual respect for each other.
                At school, we can enjoy different cultural and confidence-building activities and, at the same time, realize and demonstrate our individual talents. Everybody has an opportunity to take part in dramatic and musical performances at a school or class party, or in school or interschool sports competitions.
                These activities provide variety to the main educational programs and can also be enjoyed away from school and outside regular school hours. Now, many of them, such as sports like basketball, football, and volleyball, and other more intellectual interests such as maths, science, writing, and debate are organized through clubs.
                After the home, school is the main social environment for young people. At school we make our best friends, with whom we spend considerable time going together to dances, concerts, discos and the cinema.

<h2>Relative Clauses - Explanation and Interactive Features</h2>
<iframe src="C:\Users\user\OneDrive\Рабочий стол\мультимедия\Lesson 10. Relative clause.pdf" width="780" height="569" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true"></iframe>

<div class="content">
    <h3>Explanation of Relative Clauses</h3>
    <p>
        Relative clauses provide additional information about a noun, and they are introduced by relative pronouns such as <strong>who, whom, whose, which,</strong> and <strong>that</strong>. 
        There are two main types of relative clauses: defining (restrictive) and non-defining (non-restrictive).
    </p>
    
    <h4>1. Defining (Restrictive) Relative Clauses</h4>
    <p>
        A defining relative clause gives essential information about the noun it modifies. It cannot be omitted without changing the meaning of the sentence. These clauses are necessary to identify the noun and do not use commas.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> "The man <span id="defining-example1">who lives next door</span> is a doctor."</p>
        <p>Here, "<span id="defining-example1">who lives next door</span>" specifies which man, so it’s essential to the meaning.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Example 2:</strong> "She chose the book <span id="defining-example2">that was on the top shelf</span>."</p>
        <p>Without "<span id="defining-example2">that was on the top shelf</span>," we wouldn't know which book she chose.</p>
    </div>

    <h5>Relative Pronouns in Defining Clauses:</h5>
    <ul class="key-points">
        <li><strong>Who</strong>: Used for people (subject of the clause).</li>
        <li><strong>Whom</strong>: Used for people (object of the clause, though this is often replaced by "who" in informal English).</li>
        <li><strong>Whose</strong>: Shows possession, used for both people and things.</li>
        <li><strong>Which</strong>: Used for animals and things.</li>
        <li><strong>That</strong>: Can be used for people, animals, or things (more informal).</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>2. Non-Defining (Non-Restrictive) Relative Clauses</h4>
    <p>
        A non-defining relative clause adds extra, non-essential information to a sentence. This information can be removed without changing the main meaning. These clauses are separated by commas.
    </p>
    <div class="example">
        <p><strong>Example 1:</strong> "My brother, <span id="non-defining-example1">who lives in London</span>, is visiting next week."</p>
        <p>The clause "<span id="non-defining-example1">who lives in London</span>" gives extra information about the brother but isn’t essential to the main sentence.</p>
    </div>

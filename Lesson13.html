            <p> A library is a good place to gather information and to find interesting books and magazines to read.
                Sometimes, we want to take information on a certain topic to write a school report. The books and magazines we might use are called reference works. They collectively give us a comprehensive review of a subject from many different points of view, and often will refer us to additional sources of information as well.
                An encyclopaedia is one of the most useful reference works to use when gathering facts for a report. An encyclopedia is a book or set of books that gives basic information about many different subjects such as countries, famous people, and scientific discoveries. In an encyclopaedia you could find an article about the history of China or the invention of the bicycle. All the topics in an encyclopaedia are arranged in the alphabetic order. Another good reference work is an almanac. An almanac is a single book that gives you the latest facts and figures about many subjects. Most almanacs are printed every year. They give you lists of facts about important records, events, and people.
                An atlas is a book of maps. It has a table of contents and an index to help you find the map you need. The most complete kind of atlas is a world atlas that contains maps of separate countries and the world.
                There are also other kinds of maps. A road map can help you plan an automobile trip. A relief map shows you what the land in an area looks like with mountains, valleys, and bodies of water.
                Periodicals are magazines or newspapers that are published at regular time intervals, such as week-ly, monthly, bi-monthly, and even quarterly. Most magazines are printed either weekly or monthly. You can find magazines about hobbies, news, and many other subjects.
                Books are classified or separated into two major categories: fiction and non-fiction. Books of fiction contain stories that are imaginary. The writer makes up the characters and events. Sometimes a writer bases a fictional story on real events. Adventure stories that take place in ancient times may be based on real events or people. Some of the different kinds of fiction you can read are tales, myths, legends, science fiction, poetry, plays, and long stories called novels.
                Non-fiction books are about real events, people, or nature. They give factual material about an endless variety of subjects, including such things as his-tory, science, or mathematics.
                A story written about someone's life is called a biography. An autobiography is a story written by someone about his or her own life. Both types of books are classified as non-fiction because they deal with real facts.

                            <p>Cleft sentences are a way of emphasizing a particular part of a sentence by splitting it into two clauses. The term "cleft" comes from the idea of "splitting." These structures are used to highlight specific information in a sentence, making it stand out more clearly to the reader or listener.</p>
                            <p>There are three main types of cleft sentences:</p>

                            <h3>1. It-Cleft Sentences</h3>
                            <p>An "it-cleft" sentence begins with <code>It is/was</code> and is followed by the emphasized element. The rest of the sentence provides additional information in a relative clause.</p>
                    
                            <div class="example">
                                <p><strong>Example:</strong><br>
                                    <code>Normal sentence:</code> John found the missing keys.<br>
                                    <code>It-cleft:</code> It was John who found the missing keys.
                                </p>

                            <p><strong>Structure:</strong> <code>It is/was + emphasized element + relative clause</code></p>
                            <p class="usage">Usage: Used to emphasize specific people, things, or parts of a sentence.</p>

                            <h3>2. Wh-Cleft Sentences (or Pseudo-Cleft Sentences)</h3>
                            <p>A "wh-cleft" sentence starts with a <strong>wh-word</strong> (e.g., "what," "where," "why") followed by a verb. It emphasizes the part after the wh-clause.</p>
                    
                            <div class="example">

                            <p>Sometimes, other words (e.g., "all," "the person who," "the thing that") are used in cleft constructions for emphasis.</p>
                    
                            <div class="example">
                                <p><strong>Examples:</strong><br>
